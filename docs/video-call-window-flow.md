# Video Call Window Documentation

## Overview

The video call window system in Rocket.Chat Electron has two main parts:

1. **Window Management** - How the video call window is created and managed
2. **Screen Sharing** - How screen sharing works within the video call

### üñ•Ô∏è [Screen Sharing Flow](./video-call-screen-sharing.md) 
**What it covers:** How screen sharing works when you're already in a video call.

This document explains what happens when you click the screen share button during a video call. It shows how the app finds all your windows and screens, how it makes the selection process fast with smart caching, and how it ensures what you choose actually works before sharing it with others.

**You'll learn about:**
- How the app discovers all your open windows and screens
- Why screen sharing feels instant the second time you use it
